abstract: "In recent years, high-speed navigation and environment interaction in the context of aerial
robotics has become a field of interest for several academic and industrial research studies.
In particular, Search and Intercept (SaI) applications for aerial robots pose a compelling
research area due to their potential usability in several environments. Nevertheless, SaI
tasks involve a challenging development regarding sensory weight, on-board computation
resources, actuation design and algorithms for perception and control, among others. In this
work, a fully-autonomous aerial robot for high-speed object grasping has been proposed. As
an additional sub-task, our system is able to autonomously pierce balloons located in poles
close to the surface. Our first contribution is the design of the aerial robot at an actuation
and sensory level consisting of a novel gripper design with additional sensors enabling the
robot to grasp objects at high speeds. The second contribution is a complete software
framework consisting of perception, state estimation, motion planning, motion control and
mission control in order to rapid- and robustly perform the autonomous grasping mission.
Our approach has been validated in a challenging international competition and has shown
outstanding results, being able to autonomously search, follow and grasp a moving object
at 6 m/s in an outdoor environment."
