I had the privilege to lead the perception efforts for the 2020 Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC), a fiercely competitive event held in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Among over 25 top universities, our team clinched 3rd place in the Grand Challenge. Throughout the project, I was responsible for developing perception modules for an autonomous drone, tailored for deployment on an Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier platform. This endeavor involved a year-long commitment to researching and developing both hardware and software stacks in preparation for the competition.
