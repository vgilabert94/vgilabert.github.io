This project represents a significant aspect of my work as a Freelancer specializing in Computer Vision. However, due to confidentiality agreements, I am unable to disclose internal data.

The project entailed the application of advanced computer vision techniques, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification, among others, to analyze supermarket imagery. Cloud-based computing infrastructure played a crucial role in the implementation.

With a duration of 8 months, the project was meticulously scoped and focused on preparing for subsequent phases.
